# llmchess



Now finishing the project today.  

My engine is inside engine.py. I want to send each move to the engine. if the move is the first move i want to return "first move". What do i need to implement in my engine.py for that and what do i habve to add in my app.py?

can i use lichess as an wrapper somehow? fuck that i will do it from scratch with python. here the idea is to
