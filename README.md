# llmchess

can i use lichess as an wrapper somehow? fuck that i will do it from scratch with python. here the idea is to

- [ ] make only legal moves possible



- [ ] analytics!! to see how often the game was played. also save the played games?
- [ ] outreach
    - [ ] lesswrong
    - [ ] reddit  
    - [ ] ynews
    - [ ] twitter 
    - [ ] discord 
    - [ ] freedom slack (before fix bot)


## Notes

For the mvp user can only insert open ai keys. and there is one basic prompt (that one from from less wrong) in the future the plan is to add more features like adding other language models and also choosing between to benchmark what works better. People can contribute via simple pull request.

I want to create a online chessgame which other people can use for playing chess against and engine. the engine is a simple python script i have. how can i do create such a game for the public?
