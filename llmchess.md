I have seen so many posts about people testing the abilities of llm when playing chess. I also did it bymyself and i ca confirm its a shitty user experience. This is why i build llmchess. A open source chess engine powered by llm. For now only for support via open ai models but i can see this project as something which can evolve over time. I.e. the bigger picture is to have llm chess benchmark engine here. Ideally there is support for all sorts of language models.
